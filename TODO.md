# Project PlanX — TODO List

- [ ] Week 1 (Oct 1–7, 2025): Repository setup, Docker environment, CI, Deribit ingestion, first IV smiles.  
- [ ] Week 2 (Oct 8–14, 2025): SABR/SVI calibration, no-arbitrage checks, baseline reports.  
- [ ] Week 3 (Oct 15–21, 2025): Neural volatility surface (NN prototype), no-arb penalties, comparison with SABR/SVI.  
- [ ] Week 4 (Oct 22–28, 2025): Neural surface integration with pricing API, Greeks, FastAPI service. SPX data purchase (Oct 25), ingestion and comparison with Deribit smiles.  
- [ ] Week 5 (Oct 29–Nov 4, 2025): Simulation environment (GBM/Heston), baseline delta hedge.  
- [ ] Week 6 (Nov 5–11, 2025): RL PPO agent (no costs), first comparison with delta hedge.  
- [ ] Week 7 (Nov 12–18, 2025): RL under stress scenarios (vol spikes, jumps), robustness checks.  
- [ ] Week 8 (Nov 19–25, 2025): Packaging v1.0, documentation, Streamlit demo, release.  
- [ ] Week 9 (Nov 26–Dec 2, 2025): FX extension (EURUSD surface), SABR/SVI and NN comparison.  
- [ ] Week 10 (Dec 3–9, 2025): Rough volatility (rBergomi) MC, surrogate NN training.  
- [ ] Week 11 (Dec 10–16, 2025): Portfolio hedging with RL (multiple options + underlying).  
- [ ] Week 12 (Dec 17–23, 2025): Backtesting on SPX EOD data, RL vs delta hedge, final white paper v2.0.
